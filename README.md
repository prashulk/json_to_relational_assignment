# json_to_relational_assignment

### Introduction:
The structure or the sequence used here is:
  - Initially, the ***json*** files are read using Jupyter Notebook, to read the data, do first round of data quality checks and cleaning (with assumptions stated).
  - Post initial cleaning of JSON, database connection is setup to Postgres and keeping relational design in mind, the data is inserted into the relational tables.
  - Second set of data quality inspection is done in Postgres, with the data model in mind. Screenshots/SQL code is attached as proof for the same.
